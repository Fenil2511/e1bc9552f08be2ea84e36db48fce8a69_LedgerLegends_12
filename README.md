## Cryptocurrency Flow Investigation Tool

This project is a cryptocurrency flow investigation tool designed to help users visualize transaction details and gather information based on a transaction hash.

## Features

* **Hash Input:** Users can provide a single transaction hash as input.
* **Visualization:** The tool generates a visual representation of the transaction flow, potentially including sender, receiver, and intermediary addresses (using libraries like `graphviz`).
* **Information Gathering:** The tool extracts and displays relevant information about the transaction, such as amount, timestamp, and block number (depending on the supported blockchain).

## Requirements

* **Python 3 (with required libraries)**
    * Replace this line with specific libraries (e.g., `requests`, `graphviz`)
* **Access to a blockchain data source (API or local node)**
    * Specify the supported blockchain(s) (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/crypto-flow-investigation.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd crypto-flow-investigation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure data source:**

   - Follow instructions for setting up your chosen blockchain data source (API key or local node configuration).

4. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter a transaction hash. Once entered, the tool will process the hash and display the transaction visualization and information.

## Disclaimer

This is a basic investigation tool and may not capture all aspects of a complex transaction flow. It is recommended to consult additional resources and blockchain explorers for comprehensive analysis.

## Further Development

* Support for multiple blockchain platforms.
* Integration with additional data sources for enriched information (e.g., exchange rates, wallet labels).
* Advanced visualization options for complex transaction flows.
